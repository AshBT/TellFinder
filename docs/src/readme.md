TellFinder <span class="tagline">visual analytics to counter human trafficking</span>
=======================================================

TellFinder™ provides efficient visual analytics to detect and combat human trafficking by automatically characterizing and organizing publicly available Internet escort advertisements. 

In analyzing potentially illicit web postings, intelligence and crime analysts, border agents, law enforcement agents and civil society organizations must invest significant resources in highly manual web searches. As such postings proliferate and just as quickly disappear from the Internet, these processes often fail to capture the scope and complete patterns of the entities and organizations behind them.

With TellFinder's web-based interface, analysts can access an archive of historical advertisements from which meaningful attributes are extracted and aggregated. TellFinder groups ads into succinct visual elements that summarize the behaviour of and relationships between the entities that post them.

Compared to standard web search engines, TellFinder enables analysts to research case-related data and tips in significantly less time. Reviewing TellFinder's automatically characterized ad groups also allows analysts to track activity patterns over time, discover previously unknown actors and infer organizational relationships.
