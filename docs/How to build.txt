OpenAds is an Eclipse project.
  The /src directory contains all of the server-side Java code to be compiled into xdataht.jar
  The /war directory contains all of the web application setup including client-side html and javascript
  The build.xml script is an ant build script that will build a .war file and deploy to a location specified in build.properties

OpenAds connects to a MySQL database via jdbc.
  The memex_ht database schema contains the ads with some feature extraction and is produced by IST.
  The memex_oculus database schema contains cleaned and normalized features
